# This is the default configuration file. This could be named docker-compose.dev.yml or similar, however the lack of a docker-compose.yml
# would confuse Compose if there's a docker-compose.yml anywhere in any parent directory of the project checkout path (it would run that,
# and switch the compose project directory completely to that).
#
# Thus, this is designed to be the main config file, and everything else to be added to this as overlays in your .env file.
